#                         AI HR Attrition Prediction System
Project Overview:
This project is an AI-based system that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave an organization based on their profile information. The goal is to help HR departments identify attrition risks early and take preventive actions.

This project was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence term project.

### Problem Statement

Employee attrition causes financial loss and operational disruption. This system uses machine learning to predict attrition so organizations can improve employee retention strategies.

#### Technologies Used:
Python,Pandas,NumPy,Scikit-learn,Streamlit,Joblib

#                     How to Run the Project
### Step 1:Install Dependencies

Open terminal inside the project folder and run:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
### Step 2: Train the Model
python train_model.py

This will generate the trained model file:

model.pkl
### Step 3: Run the Application
python -m streamlit run app.py

A browser window will open where you can enter employee data and get predictions.

### Features

Predicts employee attrition(Leave or Stay)

Simple web interface

Uses real HR dataset

Real-time prediction using trained ML model

AI Usage Declaration

AI tools were used for learning concepts, debugging errors, and writing basic boilerplate code. All implementation logic was understood and customized by the student.
