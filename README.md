# 🌟 AI HR Attrition Prediction System

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is an AI-based system that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave an organization based on their profile information.  
The goal is to help HR departments identify attrition risks early and take preventive actions.

This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence term project**.

## 📝 Problem Statement
Employee attrition causes financial loss and operational disruption.  
This system uses machine learning to predict attrition so organizations can improve employee retention strategies.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas 📊  
- NumPy 🔢  
- Scikit-learn 🤖  
- Streamlit 🌐  
- Joblib 💾

# 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Open a terminal inside the project folder and run:


```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

⚠️ Tip: Make sure Python 3.10 or higher is installed. You can use VS Code, PyCharm, or any Python IDE.

### Step 2: Train the Model

Run the training script to generate the model:

python train_model.py

This will create the trained model file:
model.pkl ✅

### Step 3: Run the Web Application

Start the Streamlit app with:

python -m streamlit run app.py

A browser window will open automatically.

Enter employee details in the form.

Click Predict to see if the employee is likely to Leave or Stay.

### 🌐 You can use any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) to run the app.
